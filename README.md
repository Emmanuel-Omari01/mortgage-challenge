# Mortgage Calculator Java Project

## Project Overview
Develop a Mortgage Calculator application that allows users to calculate mortgage payments based on different parameters. The application should incorporate various Java concepts and features to enhance your programming skills.

## Functional Requirements
- **Loan Information Input:**
    - Users should be able to input essential loan details such as loan amount, interest rate, and loan duration (in years).
    - Validate input data to ensure it meets reasonable criteria.
- **Mortgage Calculation:**
    - Implement a mortgage calculation engine that determines monthly mortgage payments using the loan details provided.
    - Consider different types of interest calculations, such as fixed or adjustable rates.
- **Display Results:**
    - Present the calculated mortgage payment, including a breakdown of principal and interest components, to the user.
- **Loan Comparison:**
    - Allow users to compare different loan scenarios by adjusting parameters and viewing the resulting changes in mortgage payments.

## Advanced Java Concepts Integration
- **Enums, Annotations, and Inner Classes:**
    - Use enums to represent different loan types or payment frequencies.
    - Utilize annotations to add metadata to certain elements within your application.
    - Implement inner classes where appropriate to encapsulate functionality.
- **Java Collections Framework:**
    - Utilize collections (e.g., List, Map) to manage and organize data within the application.
    - Explore the use of advanced collection types like TreeSet or LinkedHashMap where applicable.
- ...

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **User Interface (UI):**
    - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the Mortgage Calculator.
    - Ensure a responsive design that accommodates various screen sizes.
- **Documentation:**
    - Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for your code, including inline comments.
    - Create a user manual explaining how to use the Mortgage Calculator.
- ...

## Project Milestones
- **Project Setup:**
    - Set up the development environment, including IDE, version control, and project structure.
- **User Interface Design:**
    - Design the UI components and layout for the Mortgage Calculator.
- ...

## Enhancements (Stretch Goals)
- **Integration with External APIs:**
    - Explore integration with external financial or real estate APIs to enrich the Mortgage Calculator's capabilities.
- **Advanced UI Features:**
    - Implement advanced UI features such as charts, graphs, or interactive visualizations.
- ...
